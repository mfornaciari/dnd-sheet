description:
  You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy.
  The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration.
  You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick,
  or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick.
  The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.

  When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
  the creature must make a dexterity saving throw.
  On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage.
  On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
