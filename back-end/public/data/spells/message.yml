description:
  You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message.
  The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

  You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier.
  Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell.
  The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.
