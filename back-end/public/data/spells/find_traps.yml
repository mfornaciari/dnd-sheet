description:
  You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight.
  A trap, for the purpose of this spell,
  includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable,
  which was specifically intended as such by its creator.
  Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the _alarm_ spell, a _glyph of warding_, or a mechanical pit trap,
  but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

  This spell merely reveals that a trap is present.
  You don't learn the location of each trap,
  but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
