  Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a 30-foot radius around you.

  and have advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them
  until the spell ends.
  In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack,
  the aura flashes with brilliant light.
  The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.
